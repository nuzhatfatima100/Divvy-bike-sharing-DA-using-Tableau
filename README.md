## **Data Analysis & Findings**  
### 🚲 **Peak Usage Patterns**  
- Most rides occur **on weekdays at 8 AM and 5 PM**, aligning with commute hours.  
- **Weekend ridership is lower**, indicating an opportunity for promotions.  

### 🌞 **Seasonal Trends**  
- Summer months (**especially August**) show the highest ridership.  
- **Winter months experience a decline**, suggesting seasonal demand fluctuations.  

### 📍 **High-Demand Stations**  
- **Busiest Station:** *Canal St & Adams St* → Highest trip starts and ends.  
- **Rebalancing Needed:** Bikes should be redistributed from nearby low-usage stations.  

### 📊 **Demographic Insights**  
- **Male riders outnumber female riders significantly.**  
- A **marketing strategy targeting female users** could boost engagement.  

### 💰 **Pricing Strategy**  
- **Surge pricing recommendation** during peak hours (**8 AM & 5 PM**).  
- **Incentivized pricing** for female riders to encourage greater participation.
